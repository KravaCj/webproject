how to start:
1) Run the maven project (a folder called "webproject").

2) We connect the MySQL database, add jar to Classpath (if idea then File -> Project Structure -> SDKs and
section Classpath). Next we add the database with the name mysql. As a result, we get
mysql @ localhost

3) Re-maven the project (clear + install).

4) Connect apache-tomcat-9.0.1! (For an idea: Edit Configurations -> add -> Tomcat Server ->
Local). Next, select Tomcat 9.0.1 (which is in the folder "localtest"). In the section: (Deployment ->
External sourse), add our wizard: (webproject -> target -> webproject ... war).

5) Run, if there are any problems, check the connection settings to the database in
packages: com.mysite.connection.ConnectionToDB.class

6) Tables in the database are created automatically when the program starts.

6) Successes
